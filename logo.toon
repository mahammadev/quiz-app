[BRAND_IDENTITY: QAVRA]

[PHILOSOPHY: THE GRASP]
- THE NAME: "Qavra" (To grasp, to comprehend).
- THE SYMBOL: The Raven (The smartest bird, the tool-user).
- THE LINK: Intelligence, Vision, and the physical act of "grasping" knowledge.

[THE_MARK: "THE GEOMETRIC RAVEN"]
- CONCEPT: A minimalist silhouette of a Raven (intelligence) constructed from sharp, origami-like folds (structure/knowledge).
- ICON_TYPE: Abstract Animal Silhouette / Object.
- VISUAL_VIBE: Think "Apple" or "Twitter" — a singular, memorable shape that doesn't need to explain itself.

[DESIGN_TOKENS]
- PRIMARY_COLOR: #6442ef (Electric Indigo)
- ACCENT_COLOR: #efeef6 (Soft Lavender for secondary details)
- RADIUS_LOGIC: Use the 12px "Qavra-Smooth" rounding on the outer points of the bird, but keep the internal "folds" sharp for contrast.

[COMPONENT: THE MARK]
- SILHOUETTE: A side-profile of a perched or soaring raven, simplified into 4-5 geometric polygons.
- SECRET_DETAIL: The negative space between the wing and the body subtly forms the curve of a 'Q'.
- STYLE: Bold, thick vector lines. No gradients. Solid #6442ef.

[COMPONENT: THE WORDMARK]
- FONT: Plus Jakarta Sans (Customized).
- WEIGHT: Extra Bold.
- TREATMENT: The 'Q' in Qavra should be a simple circle with a 45-degree slash, perfectly echoing the geometry of the Raven icon.

[AI_MASTER_PROMPT]
"A high-end, iconic brand mark for a company named 'Qavra'. The logo features a minimalist, geometric silhouette of a Raven, designed in a modern origami style. The bird is composed of sharp, clean-cut polygons with slightly rounded outer edges (12px radius style). The color is a single, solid block of Electric Indigo (#6442ef). Next to it, the wordmark 'Qavra' is written in a heavy, professional geometric sans-serif (Plus Jakarta Sans). The design is purely 2D, flat vector, high-contrast, and bold—reminiscent of the Apple or Airbnb logo style. Isolated on a white background, 8k, master-grade branding."
